# CERT ACQUIRED

Today I acquired the Security Blue Team: Blue Team Level 1 Certification! This certification was a great demonstration of my skills in Blue Team activities such as Threat Intelligence, Digital Forensics and Incident Response, Security Incident and Event Management, and Phishing Analysis.

## Study / Prep

Security Blue Team offers their own comprehensive training regimen for this cert, which I felt in addition to my Cybersecurity Bachelors education, provided me with exactly the skills I needed to perform in the realistic test environment. This includes a brush up on security fundamentals and then 5 domains relating to Blue Team activities, which are Threat Intelligence, Digital Forensics and Incident Response, Security Incident and Event Management, and Phishing Analysis. Each domain has a good mixture of classroom education and labs to ensure you are well versed in the tools and methodologies necessary to succeed.

## Test Day

For the test you are thrown into a simulated corporate environment and asked to complete 20 tasks within an allotted 24 hour time frame. I was confident going in that I was well prepared and ready to ace this cert. I diligently completed the tasks assigned to me using different SIEM and DFIR tools. After I was confident the tasks were handled, I submitted my results. I was pleased to find out I received 100% on my first attempt and earned the coveted gold challenge coin from Security Blue Team!
