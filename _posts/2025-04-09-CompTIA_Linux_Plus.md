# CERT ACQUIRED

Today I acquired the CompTIA Linux+ Certification! This certification was a great demonstration of my skills Linux such as installation, configuration, security troubleshooting, and command-line operations.

## Study / Prep

I relied on my strong background in Linux from personal use and my college education for most of the fundamentals this exam goes over, including file system hierarchy, basic command line operations, and basic configurations. I used the Udemy course

## Test Day

For the test you are thrown into a simulated corporate environment and asked to complete 20 tasks within an allotted 24 hour time frame. I was confident going in that I was well prepared and ready to ace this cert. I diligently completed the tasks assigned to me using different SIEM and DFIR tools. After I was confident the tasks were handled, I submitted my results. I was pleased to find out I received 100% on my first attempt and earned the coveted gold challenge coin from Security Blue Team!
