# [STATUS] = **PASSED**

Today I acquired the Security Blue Team: Blue Team Level 1 Certification! It took me a total of 8 hours out of the 24 alloted. This certification was a demonstration of my skills in Threat Intelligence, Digital Forensics and Incident Response, Security Incident and Event Management, and Phishing Analysis.

## Study / Prep

Security Blue Team offers their own comprehensive training regemin, which I felt in addition to my Cybersecurity Bachelors education, provided me with exactly the skills I needed to perform in the realistic test environment. This includes a brush up on security fundamentals and then 5 domains of blue team activities, which are Threat Intelligence, Digital Forensics and Incident Response, Security Incident and Event Management, and Phishing Analysis. Each domain has a good mixture of classroom education and lab practicals to ensure you are well versed in the tools and methodologies necessary to succeed.
